<h2>4.1 Path objects</h2>


Path objects are defined by a set of <span class="tex-emph">subpaths</span>, that is, curves
in the plane.  Each subpath is either open or closed, and consists of
straight line segments, circular or elliptic arc segments, parabola
segments (or, equivalently, quadratic B&eacute;zier splines), cubic B&eacute;zier splines, and cubic B-spline segments.  The curves are drawn with the
stroke color, dash style, and line width; the interior of the object
specified is filled using the fill color.
<p>The distinction between open and closed subpaths is meaningful for
stroking only, for filling any open subpath is implicitely closed.
Stroking a set of subpaths is identical to stroking them individually.
This is not true for filling: using several subpaths, one can
construct objects with holes, and more complicated pattern.  The
filling algorithm is normally the <span class="tex-emph">even-odd rule</span> of
Postscript/PDF: To determine whether a point lies inside the filled
shape, draw a ray from that point in any direction, and count the
number of path segments that cross the ray.  If this number is odd,
the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.
<p>Ipe can draw arrows on the first and last segment of a path object,
but only if that segment is part of an open subpath.
<p>There are several Ipe modes that create path objects in different
ways.  All modes create an object consisting of a single subpath only.
To make more complicated path objects, such as objects with holes, you
create each boundary component separately, then select them all and
use the <span class="tex-emph">Compose paths</span> function in the <span class="tex-emph">Edit</span> menu.  The
reverse operation is <span class="tex-emph">Decompose path</span>, you find it in the context
menu of a path object that has several subpaths.
<p>You can also create complicated paths by joining curves sequentially.
For this to work, the endpoint of one path must be (nearly) identical
to the begin point of the next&mdash;easy to achieve using snapping.  You
select the path objects you wish to join, and call <span class="tex-emph">Join paths</span>
in the <span class="tex-emph">Edit</span> menu.  You can also join several open path objects
into a single closed path this way.
<p><span id="id1">  
Circles</span> can be entered in three different ways.  To create an ellipse,
create a circle and shear or stretch and rotate it.  Circular arcs can
be entered by clicking three points on the arc or by clicking the
center of the supporting circle as well as the begin and end vertex of
the arc. They can be filled in Postscript/PDF fashion, and can have
arrows. You can stretch a circular arc to create an elliptic arc.
<p>A common application for arcs is to mark angles in drawings. The snap
keys are useful to create such arcs: set arc creation to <span class="tex-emph">center
&#38; 2 pts</span>, select <span class="tex-emph">snap to vertex</span> and <span class="tex-emph">snap to boundary</span>,
click first on the center point of the angle (which is magnetic) and
click then on the two bounding lines.
<p><span id="id2">









There</span> are two modes for creating more complex general path objects.
The difference between <span class="tex-emph">line</span> mode and <span class="tex-emph">polygon</span> mode is
that the first creates an open path, the latter generates a closed
one.  As a consequence, the <span class="tex-emph">line</span> mode uses the current arrow
settings, while the <span class="tex-emph">polygon</span> mode doesn't.
The path object created using line or polygon mode consists of
segments of various types.  The initial setting is to create straight
segments. By holding the shift-key when pressing the left mouse button
one can switch to splines.  Ipe offers three different kinds of
splines: uniform B-splines, cardinal splines, and clothoid splines.
You can select the type of spline in the <span class="tex-emph">Properties</span> menu.
Quadratic and cubic B&eacute;zier spline segments can be created as special
cases of uniform B-splines with three and four control points.
<p>Circular arcs can be added as follows: Click twice in polyline mode,
once on the starting point of the arc, then on a point in the correct
tangent direction.  Press the <font color="#0000ff">a</font> key, and click on the endpoint
of the arc.
<p>To make curves where segments of different type are joined with
identical tangents, you can press the <font color="#0000ff">y</font> key whenever you are
starting a new segment: this will set the coordinate system centered
at the starting point of the segment, and aligned with the tangent to
the previous segment. 
<p>For the mathematically inclined, a more precise description of the
segments that can appear on a subpath follows.
<p>A subpath consists of a sequence of segments.  Each segment is either
a straight line segment, an elliptic arc, or a spline of one of the
three supported types.
<p>Note that a uniform B-spline with only three control points will be
drawn as a <span class="tex-emph">quadratic</span> B&eacute;zier spline.  A B-spline with four
control points is by definition a cubic B&eacute;zier spline.
<p>The quadratic B&eacute;zier spline defined by control points <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>,
<i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, and <i>p<sub>2</sub></i>, is the curve
<div class="tex-math"><i>
P(t) = (1-t)<sup>2</sup> p<sub>0</sub> + 2t(1-t) p<sub>1</sub> + t<sup>2</sup> p<sub>2</sub>,
</i></div>
where&nbsp;<i>t</i> ranges from <i>0</i> to <i>1</i>. This implies that it starts in
<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> tangent to the line <i>p<sub>0</sub>p<sub>1</sub></i>, ends in <i>p<sub>2</sub></i> tangent to
the line <i>p<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub></i>, and is contained in the convex hull of the
three points.  Any segment of any parabola can be expressed as a
quadratic B&eacute;zier spline.
<p>For instance, the piece of the unit parabola <i>y = x<sup>2</sup></i> between <i>x=a</i>
and <i>x=b</i> can be created with the control points
<blockquote><table border><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>
p<sub>0</sub> </td><td colspan="1" align="center"> = </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> (a, a<sup>2</sup>)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
p<sub>1</sub> </td><td colspan="1" align="center"> = </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> ( (a + b)/(2), ab) </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
p<sub>2</sub> </td><td colspan="1" align="center"> = </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> (b, b<sup>2</sup>)
</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>
Any piece of any parabola can be created by applying some affine
transformation to these points.
<p>The cubic B&eacute;zier spline with control points <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>,
 <i>p<sub>2</sub></i>, and <i>p<sub>3</sub></i> is the curve
<div class="tex-math"><i>
R(t) = (1-t)<sup>3</sup>p<sub>0</sub> + 3t(1-t)<sup>2</sup> p<sub>1</sub> + 
3 t<sup>2</sup>(1-t) p<sub>2</sub> + t<sup>3</sup> p<sub>3</sub>.
</i></div>
It starts in <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> being tangent to the line <i>p<sub>0</sub>p<sub>1</sub></i>, ends in
<i>p<sub>3</sub></i> being tangent to the line <i>p<sub>2</sub>p<sub>3</sub></i>, and lies in the convex
hull of the four control points.
<p>Uniform cubic B-splines approximate a series of <i>n</i> control points
<i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>p<sub>n-1</sub></i>, <i>n  &ge; 3</i>, with a curve
consisting of <i>n-3</i> cubic B&eacute;zier splines, see, for instance,
Sederberg.<sup><a href="manual_74.html#id1">1</a></sup>  To clamp the spline to the first and last control
point, the first and last knot are repeated three times.  If the curve
is closed (a <span class="tex-emph">splinegon</span>), there is no clamping and <i>n</i> control
points define&nbsp;<i>n</i> B&eacute;zier splines.
<p>Since each point on a B&eacute;zier curve is a convex combination of the
four control points, the curve segment lies in the convex hull of the
control points. Furthermore, any affine transformation can be applied
to the curve by applying it to the control points.  Note that a
control point has influence on only a few B&eacute;zier segments, so when
you edit a spline object and move a control point, only a short piece
of the spline in the neighborhood of the control point will move.
<p>A <span class="tex-emph">cardinal spline</span> is an <span class="tex-emph">interpolating spline</span>&mdash;unlike a
uniform B-spline, it will go <span class="tex-emph">through</span> the control points.  Ipe
converts a sequence of&nbsp;<i>n</i> control points into&nbsp;<i>n-1</i> B&eacute;zier segments,
each starting and ending at a control point.  The tangent at each
control point is parallel to the segment connecting the previous and
the next control point.
<p>Finally, a <span class="tex-emph">clothoid spline</span> (spline type "spiro") is 
created by solving an optimization problem that tries to minimize the
change in curvature (so they look much "rounder" and are generally
more pleasing).  Details can be found in <a href="http://levien.com">Raph Levien's
  thesis</a>.
