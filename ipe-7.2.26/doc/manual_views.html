<h2>8.2 Views</h2>

<p>When making a PDF presentation for a PDF Viewer or for IpePresenter,
one would often like to present a page incrementally. For instance, I
would first like to show a polygon, then add its triangulation, and
finally color the vertices.  <span class="tex-emph">Views</span> make it possible to do this
nicely.
<p>An Ipe document consists of several pages, each of which can consist
of an arbitrary number of views.  When saving as PDF, each view
generates a separate PDF page (if you only look at the result in a PDF
viewer, you cannot tell whether two pages are actually two views of
the same Ipe page or two different Ipe pages).
<p>An Ipe page consists of a number of objects, a number of layers, and a
number of views.  Each object belongs to exactly one layer.  A layer
can be shown by any number of views&mdash;a view is really just a list of
layers to be presented. In addition, a view keeps a record of the
current active layer&mdash;this makes it easy to move around your views
and edit them.
<p>Views can also give a different meaning to symbolic attributes, so
that objects that appear in blue on one view will be red on the next
one.  One can also change the dash pattern and pen width, and can even
replace one symbol by a different one.
<p>As a somewhat experimental feature, views can transform individual
layers of the page.  This allows you to move around or rotate objects
from view to view, without having to make copies of the objects.
<p>Finally, views can specify a graphic effect to be used by the PDF
viewer when proceeding to the following PDF page.

<h3 id="id1">8.2.1 Example</h3>
<p>To return to our polygon triangulation example, let's create an empty
page.  We draw a polygon into the default layer "alpha."  Now use
the <span class="tex-emph">New layer, new view</span> function (in the <span class="tex-emph">Views</span> menu),
and draw the triangulation into the new layer "beta."  Note that the
function not only created a new layer, but also a second view showing
both "alpha" and "beta".  Try moving back and forth between the
two views (using the PageUp and PageDown keys). You'll see changes in
the layer list on the left: in view&nbsp;1, layer "alpha" is selected and
active, in view&nbsp;2, both layers are selected and "beta" is active.
Create a third layer and view, and mark the vertices.  
<p>Save in PDF format, and voila, you have a lovely little presentation.
The result is available <a href="polygon.pdf">here</a>.

<h3 id="id2">8.2.2 Text boxes</h3>
<p>In presentations, one often has slides with mostly text.  The
<a href="manual_17.html">textbox</a> object is convenient for this, as one
doesn't need to use the mouse to create it.  To create a slide where
several text items appear one by one, one only needs to press F10 to
create a textbox, then <font color="#0000ff">Shift+Ctrl+I</font> to make a new view, F10
again for the next textbox, and so on.  Finally, one moves the
textboxes vertically for the most pleasing effect
(<span class="tex-emph">Shift+Alt+Left Mouse</span> does a constrained vertical translation,
or <span class="tex-emph">Shift+Left Mouse</span> in <span class="tex-emph">Translate</span> mode).

<h3 id="id3">8.2.3 Changing symbolic values inside a view</h3>
<p>Imagine you have an object that is shown in dark orange on your
current page, but on one specific view you want to highlight the
object in purple.
<p>To achieve this, go to the view, and open <span class="tex-emph">Edit view</span> from the
<span class="tex-emph">Views</span> menu.  In the attribute map field, write this line:
<pre class="tex-verbatim">
color:darkorange=purple;
</pre>
You will notice that all objects on the page that had the
<code>darkorange</code> color now show in purple.
<p>You can similarly map other attribute values, for instance:
<pre class="tex-verbatim">
color:navy=red;
color:darkorange=purple;
symbolsize:large=tiny;
pen:ultrafat=normal;
dashstyle:dotted=dashed;
symbol:mark/disk(sx)=mark/box(sx);
</pre>
The attribute kinds you are allowed to modify are "pen", "symbolsize",
"arrowsize", "opacity", "color", "dashstyle", and "symbol".  Both the
original and the new attribute must by symbolic attributes defined in
your style sheet.
<p>It's probably not a good idea to remap common attributes in your
document&mdash;this may quickly become confusing.  A better approach would
be to create dedicated attribute values like <code>emphasis</code>, that
map to some standard value in the stylesheet, and which you can then
redefine in the views where you want to emphasize the object.

<h3 id="id4">8.2.4 Transforming objects inside a view</h3>
<p>The second large text field inside the <span class="tex-emph">Edit view</span> dialog allows
you to specify transformations for each layer of the page.  For
instance, you could write these definitions:
<pre class="tex-verbatim">
alpha=[1 0 0 1 20 100];
beta=[1 0 0 0.8 0 0];
</pre>
This will translate all objects in layer alpha by the vector&nbsp;<i>(20,
100)</i> (that is, 20&nbsp;units to the right and 100&nbsp;units upwards), while
all objects in layer beta are scaled in the <i>y</i>-direction by
factor&nbsp;<i>0.8</i>.
<p>This is somewhat experimental&mdash;there is no good UI to figure out the
right transformation matrices (you may want to draw a helper object,
apply the transformation, and then use <span class="tex-emph">Edit as XML</span> to look at
the object's matrix field).
<p>Also, Ipe still considers the objects to be at their original place,
it just displays them elsewhere.  For instance, to modify an object
you have to select it by clicking at its original location. (So, to
modify an object, it is best is to go back to the original view where
you made the object.)
<p>Currently, the layer transformation is not taken into account when
computing the bounding box of a page, so make sure you have other
objects creating a suitable bounding box.

<h3 id="id5">8.2.5 Controlling the PDF bounding box of a view</h3>
<p>Note that all views of a page receive the same bounding box,
containing all objects visible on some view, plus all objects in a
layer named "BBOX" (even if that layer is not visible).  This can be
used to force a larger bounding box without adding a white rectangle
or the like.
<p>If you need independent bounding boxes for each view, create a layer
named "VIEWBBOX".  Any view in which this layer is visible will
receive a bounding box computed for the objects visible in this view
only.
