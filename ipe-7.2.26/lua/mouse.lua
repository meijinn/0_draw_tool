-- Available actions are:
-- "select"
-- "translate", "rotate", "stretch",
-- "scale" (like "stretch" with Shift)
-- "pan"
-- "menu" (opens context menu)
-- "shredder" (erases object closest to mouse)
-- or write a Lua function with arguments (model, modifiers)

-- left and left_shift cannot be remapped

-- More than two modifiers are possible in the order
-- shift_control_alt_meta
-- e.g. left_shift_meta = "rotate"

-- If your mouse has additional buttons, then you can also use
-- button8, button9, and button10.
-- (It seems other buttons are not passed through by Qt.)
